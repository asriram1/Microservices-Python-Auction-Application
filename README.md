# Microservices Auctions Platform


This project was developed as part of the Topics in Software Engineering - MPCS 51205 course at University of Chicago. The project is a Microservices-Based Python Auction Platform, which is split into 5 different microservices namely: an admin service, auction service, email service, user service, and a front-end microservice. All of the microservices are orchestrated using a mediator class. A detailed diagram of the architecture of this platform can be found in the final_architecture.xml file.
